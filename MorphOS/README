*** Caveats on not supported modules ***

/pwd/

This module is always build for all platforms, but I removed it for MorphOS.
By design its a pure Unix module and sources even include "posixmodule.h"!
I've checked the Python dependency on this module and found:

	 Lib/distutils: used on posix only platforms or safely stubbed.
	 Lib/getpass.py: needed by getuser(), but works if one of followings environments
	 				 variables is set: LOGNAME, USER, LNAME, USERNAME.
	 Lib/webbrowser.py: needed by Grail web browser, but not used on MorphOS.
	 Lib/tarfile.py: stubbed if not existing.
	 Lib/netrc.py: used on posix only platforms.
	 Lib/shutil.py: stubbed if not existing.
	 Lib/smtpd.py: can be run without pwd usage (-n option)
	 Lib/morphospath.py: WTF! I'm going to fix that immediatly! :-)
	 Lib/test/test_shutil.py: stubbed if not existing.
	 Lib/CGIHTTPServer.py: stubbed if not existing.

	 Following files are not supported on MorphOS platform:

	 Lib/test/test_posix.py
	 Lib/test/test_posixpath.py
	 Lib/test/test_pwd.py
	 Lib/posixpath.py


/grp/

 It's exactly the same problem as pwd.
