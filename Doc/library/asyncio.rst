:mod:`asyncio` -- Asynchronous I/O, event loop, coroutines and tasks
====================================================================

.. module:: asyncio
   :synopsis: Asynchronous I/O, event loop, coroutines and tasks.

.. versionadded:: 3.4


Introduction
------------

This package includes a pluggable event loop, transport and protocol
abstractions similar to those in Twisted, and a higher-level scheduler
for coroutines and tasks based on ``yield from`` (:PEP:`380`).

Full documentation is not yet ready; we hope to have it written
before Python 3.4 leaves beta.  Until then, the best reference is
:PEP:`3156`.  For a motivational primer on transports and protocols,
see :PEP:`3153`.
