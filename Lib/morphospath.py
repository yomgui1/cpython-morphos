### 20041213 | Yomgui       | Initial Release.
### 20041218 | Yomgui       | port of functions: normcase, isabs.
### 20050114 | Yomgui       | AddPart is in _doslib now.
### 20050217 | Yomgui       | FIX: split() was unported.
### 20050221 | Yomgui       | FIX: normcase() does nothing now.
### 20050223 | Yomgui       | FIX: splitdrive() is now right implemented.
### 20050303 | Yomgui       | Move AddPart() from os to os.path
### 20050316 | Yomgui       | FIX: normcase() is s.lower()
### 20050316 | Yomgui       | FIX: ':' is not an alt-separator !
### 20050420 | Yomgui       | defpath is computed from result of command 'Path'
### 20050605 | Yomgui       | FIX: normpath wasn't ported
### 20050717 | Yomgui       | PB: normpath is not correct yet!
### 20061009 | Yomgui       | FIX: join didn't put a '/' at end in some cases.

"""Common operations on Morphos pathnames.

Instead of importing this module directly, import os and refer to
this module as os.path.  The "os.path" name is an alias for this
module on Morphos systems; on other systems (e.g. Mac, Windows),
os.path provides the same operations in a manner specific to that
platform, and is an alias to another module (e.g. macpath, ntpath).

Some of this can actually be useful on non-Morphos systems too, e.g.
for manipulation of the pathname component of URLs.
