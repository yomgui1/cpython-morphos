What's New in Python 3000?
==========================

*Release date: XX-XXX-200X*

TO DO
-----

- See PEP 3000.

- Test merging certain changes from the 2.5 HEAD code.

- Weed really old/weird stuff from the library.

- Unify range() and xrange().

- Revamp the dict API: keys(), values(), items() return iterators, etc.

- Add the bytes type.

- Rework the standard I/O library to use bytes for binary files.

- Make strings all Unicode.

- Get rid of classic class implementation.

- Get rid of various compatibility-related flags (e.g. division flags).

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Classic classes are a thing of the past.  All classes are new style.

- Exceptions *must* derive from BaseException.

- Integer division always returns a float.  The -Q option is no more.
  All the following are gone:
   * PyNumber_Divide and PyNumber_InPlaceDivide
   * __div__, __rdiv__, and __idiv__
   * nb_divide, nb_inplace_divide
   * operator.div, operator.idiv, operator.__div__, operator.__idiv__
  (Only __truediv__ and __floordiv__ remain, not sure how to handle them
   if we want to re-use __div__ and friends.  If we do, it will make
   it harder to write code for both 2.x and 3.x.)

- 'as' and 'with' are keywords.

- Absolute import is the default behavior for 'import foo' etc.

- input(), raw_input() and apply() are gone.

- Removed staticforward and statichere macros.
