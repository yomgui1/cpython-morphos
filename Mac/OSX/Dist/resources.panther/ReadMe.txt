This package will install MacPython 2.3 for Mac OS X
10.3 beta (build 7B53 or later). 

Installation requires approximately 3.3 MB of disk
space, ignore the message that it will take zero bytes.

You must install onto your current boot disk, even
though the installer does not enforce this, otherwise
things will not work.

This installer does not contain a Python engine, as
Apple already includes that in 10.3. It does contain
a set of programs to allow easy
access to it for Mac users (an integrated development
environment, a Python extension package manager) and
the waste module. 

The installer puts the applications in MacPython-2.3 in
your Applications folder.

The PythonIDE application has a Help command that gets
you started quickly with MacPython and contains
references to other documentation.
